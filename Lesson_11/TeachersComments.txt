Well done!

You were kind of on the right track and your solution works the same as mine, but yours is much more complicated which is not needed.

My view of solution:
MERGE INTO res t
USING data_for_merge s ON s.Alex=t.function_name
WHEN MATCHED 
	THEN UPDATE SET function_count=function_count+1
WHEN NOT MATCHED AND Alex IS NOT NULL
	THEN INSERT (function_name, function_count)
	VALUES (Alex, 1);

MERGE INTO res t
USING data_for_merge s ON s.Barbara=t.function_name
WHEN MATCHED 
	THEN UPDATE SET function_count=function_count+1
WHEN NOT MATCHED AND Barbara IS NOT NULL
	THEN INSERT (function_name, function_count)
	VALUES (Carlos, 1);
